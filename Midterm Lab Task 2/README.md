# Midterm Lab Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Transformation using POWER QUERY
In this lab, I worked on cleaning and organizing a messy dataset using Excel's Power Query. The dataset, Uncleaned_DS_Jobs.csv, was taken from a job posting site on Kaggle. The goal was to extract useful insights by performing data cleaning and transformation tasks.
