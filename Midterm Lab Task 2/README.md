# Midterm Lab Task 2 
In this lab, Company X wants to find useful information from the UncleanedDSJobs.csv file, which comes from a job posting site on Kaggle. There are many columns in the dataset, but we will focus only on the important ones to answer specific questions. The goal is to clean and analyze the data to find patterns and gain helpful insights about job postings.
