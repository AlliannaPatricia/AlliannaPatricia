# EDM Portfolio
This portfolio shows my skills in data cleaning, organizing, and analyzing using Excel. Through different lab activities, I have learned how to make data clear, correct, and easy to use. These activities helped me improve my skills in fixing errors, sorting data, and preparing information for analysis.

It was a great experience that taught me more about databases and how they are used in real life. Another project I am proud of was cleaning data.
